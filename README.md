# threePtFn
The 3-point correlation function of galaxies in the Universe probes information that is not contained in the more ubiquitous 2-point correlation function. To utilize the information it contains, however, one must have a theoretical model for the 3-point correlation function of dark matter. This code provides the tree-level perturbation theory prediction for the 3-point correlation function of dark matter, and of galaxies using an Eulerian bias model, given an input power spectrum.

This code predicts both the real-space and redshift-space 3-point clustering of matter and galaxies.
